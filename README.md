# distraction-blocker

I find myself checking Facebook, almost impulsively, during the times I'm trying to be productive. I'm positive I'm not the only one.

So I created this extension to limit that behavior. It's simple: it sends an alert message, forever, blocking you from doing anything else other than clicking "ok", or "cancel". 

It does so via the manifest.json file, which waits for the match: facebook.com, then sends the alert message.

It serves as a reminder to continue working on things. And it also makes you mindful of impulsive Facebook checking! :o 

<strong>Update</strong>: Making use of local storage, a user will be able to view how many times they tried accessing Facebook(note: this is a 'todo', and has not yet been added)

<strong>Update #2</strong>: Added a toggle button to the extension, which will be used to enable/disable the script(i.e. the alert box.)
